Short Polling
    Periodic Updates: The client regularly sends requests to the server to check for updates.
    Simple Implementation: Easy to implement and understand, suitable for cases where real-time updates are not critical.

Pros: 
    => Simple Implementation: Easy to set up and understand, requiring only basic HTTP requests. 
    => No Persistent Connections: Avoids the complexity of managing persistent connections, suitable for environments with limited resources. 
    => Predictable Load: Server load is more predictable as requests are made at regular intervals.

Cons:
    => Inefficiency: Can be inefficient with frequent polling, increasing server load and network traffic. 
    => Latency: Updates are not immediate; the interval between polls can introduce delays in receiving data. 
    => Scalability Issues: With many clients, frequent polling can strain server resources and lead to performance bottlenecks.
